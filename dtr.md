* What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?

> Parker: Learn more about client side JS and javascript in general. Solidify the fundamentals.

> Ryan: Solidify understanding of JS, including ES6 and traditional syntax, unit and integration tests, and best practices.


* When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?

> Parker: Only time I am unavailable is Thursday night/Saturday night.
 
> Ryan: Free at all times, though meeting on Saturday at Turing can be difficult due to travel.

* How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

> Communication will remain relatively constant. Regardless of its in person, over the phone, or via slack both members of the team are expected to stay in touch and informed of project status.

* What is each group memberâ€™s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?

> Parker: General Logic and Problem Solving strengths - would like to improve upon general JS and testing as understanding is still fuzzy.

> Ryan: Would like to improve on ES6 understanding, easier implementation of testing. Feels strong on Core JS concepts.

* Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?

> Parker: Head up testing to ensure high coverage and firm up personal understanding of good test practices.

> Ryan: Understand and implement Procedural Generation and good game architecture concepts.

* What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?

> We will be using a brand of GitFlow known as HubFlow, which is centered around PR's, rather than local merges. All changes are expected to be on their own feature branch, pushed up, and approved by another team member prior to merge into develop. Releases will be handled when together.

* What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?

> Team members are expected to continue solid communication when running into an issue, and ask for help when necessary. Wasting time when stubborn should be avoided.

* How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?

> Parker: Blunt/Straight-forward, but remain civil and polite.

> Ryan: Straight-forward, to the point, and frequently.

* Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?

> N/A
