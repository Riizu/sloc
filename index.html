          Welcome to SLoC! That little silver person is you, and it's your job to defeat the bugs and clear the seventh level for release.<br>
          Those Question marks are the bugs, you can defeat them by running into them twice, but beware! Each time you hurt them, they chip away at your "Coder's Morale"<br>
          If your Coder's Morale drops to zero you lose the game and the project never reaches production. Not to fret though!<br>
          Those keys that you see are instances of Instructor Aid, each one you pick up give you +5 morale.<br>
          Like all good Coders, you are good at using exploits, the clear looking tiles will teleport you to random points in the code.<br>
          Your primary goal is to reach the staircase leading down to the next level.<br> Goodluck and Godspeed!
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          You are blue, your mission is to navigate through the layers of code prepping each one for release.<br>
          Purple: Code Exploits, these teleport you to various spots of code<br>
          Red: These are malicious bugs that live in your code, you can only defeat so many before you need instructor assistance<br>
          LightBlue: Instructor Assistance, you can pick up instructor assistance to give you the extra push you need to eliminate more bugs<br>
          Green: This is the goal that you are trying to reach for the level<br>
        </p> -->

        <!-- In order to complete this game you must venture forth through the code, eliminating bugs as you go. There are exploits available to you on your journey that will warp you to different points of the code, as well as instructor assitance that you can pick up to tackle more bugs. -->
