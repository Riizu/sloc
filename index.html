          Welcome to SLoC! That little silver person is you, and it's your job to defeat the bugs and clear the seventh level for release.<br>
          Those Question marks are the bugs, you can defeat them by running into them twice, but beware! Each time you hurt them, they chip away at your "Coder's Morale"<br>
          If your Coder's Morale drops to zero you lose the game and the project never reaches production. Not to fret though!<br>
          Those keys that you see are instances of Instructor Aid, each one you pick up give you +5 morale.<br>
          Like all good Coders, you are good at using exploits, the clear looking tiles will teleport you to random points in the code.<br>
          Your primary goal is to reach the staircase leading down to the next level.<br> Goodluck and Godspeed!
